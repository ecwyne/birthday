				<h1>Kathleen's Birthday</h1>
				<p>With Kathleen halfway around the world this year, I know many of us are trying to find a way to celebrate her and make her feel special for her birthday. I was hoping you could help me by sharing some kind words with her that she can have on her birthday and be able to keep forever.</p>
				<p>We're compiling notes for Kathleen that she'll be able to view online. Enter your email below to start writing yours! You'll be sent a link to go back to edit your note at any time.</p>
